## Intro

This is the Sanskrit documentation theme for use with the Jekyll static website generator.

Some notable things you get with this theme (in decreasing order of interest):
- A collapsible "accordion" sidebar
- A collapsible "accordion" table-of-contents for each page.
- A layout which automatically
- An "Edit me" link on top of each page.
- Search engine optimization and webmaster stuff - which you would use with various search engines.
- Google custom search configuration
- Disqus for comments.
- Google analytics configuration
- the usual Jekyll blog.
  - Post tag support

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

### Screenshots and examples
- See this test site: <>!


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sanskrit-documentation-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: sanskrit-documentation-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sanskrit-documentation-theme

## Usage

Take a look at this very repository for an example! In particular, note:
- the `_config.yml` file.
- The _data/home_sidebar.yml file, which defines the contents of the sidebar/ dropdown menu you see for each page.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development
To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `sanskrit-documentation-theme.gemspec` accordingly.
